About the Game
Pong is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen. The objective is to score points by bouncing a ball back and forth between the paddles. This project recreates that nostalgic gameplay in Python.

How to Play
Player 1 (left paddle) controls: W (up) and S (down).
Player 2 (right paddle) controls: Up arrow (up) and Down arrow (down).
The game continues until one player reaches the score limit (typically 5 or 10).
